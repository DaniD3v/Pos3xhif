## Your task

Start the solution *CarRentalService.sln*. *Program.cs* contains a test program which 
checks the implementation. The file *Program.cs* must not be modified.

Add a file for each class. At the end start *cleanSolution.cmd* to remove the
*bin* and *obj* folder. After that create a ZIP file with the complete program 
and submit it to Microsoft Teams.

Programs which do not compile as well as programs which cause runtime errors are rated as not sufficient (Nicht gen√ºgend).
