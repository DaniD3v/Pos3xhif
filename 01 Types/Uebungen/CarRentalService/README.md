# Car rental service

A car rental company rents motorcycles and cars. A daily price is charged for motorcycles.
For cars, the kilometers driven are also charged. The following class model shows a simple
implementation.

```plantuml
@startuml

class Vehicle <<abstract>> {
    +LicencePlate : string
    +PricePerDay : decimal
    +Power : int
    +{abstract} RequiredDrivingLicence : string
    ---
    +Vehicle(string licencePlate, decimal pricePerDay, int power)
    +{abstract} CalculatePrice(int days, int kilometers)
}

class Motorcycle {
    +RequiredDrivingLicence : string
    ---
    +Motorcycle(string licencePlate, decimal pricePerDay, int power)
    +decimal CalculatePrice(int days, int kilometers)
}
Motorcycle -up-|> Vehicle

class Car {
    +PricePerKm : decimal
    +Weight : decimal
    +RequiredDrivingLicence : string
    ---
    +Car(string licencePlate, decimal pricePerDay, int power, decimal pricePerKm, int weight)
    +decimal CalculatePrice(int days, int kilometers)
}

## Your task

Start the solution *CarRentalService.sln*. *Program.cs* contains a test program which 
checks the implementation. The file *Program.cs* must not be modified.

Add a file for each class. At the end start *cleanSolution.cmd* to remove the
*bin* and *obj* folder. After that create a ZIP file with the complete program 
and submit it to Microsoft Teams.

Programs which do not compile as well as programs which cause runtime errors are rated as not sufficient (Nicht gen√ºgend).
